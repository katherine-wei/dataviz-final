Asian countries adapting to Western beauty standards via cosmetic products and surgeries

The goal for my project is to show how many Asian countries have abandoned their traditional views on beauty and have chosen to adopt Western beauty standards instead. 

Korea is now the most cosmetically enhanced country in the world, and has claimed the top spot for many years already. Korean pop stars, actors/actressses and civilians are undergoing surgery to look like "Westerners," and this trend can be seen throughout most Asian countries, including China, Thailand, Japan, Singapore, even North Korea. People want bigger eyes, a more prominent nose, pale skin, hourglass fiures, etc. 

I will be using data released by the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, Korea's Fair Trade Commission, Ministry of Health and Welfares (China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and other countries).

I want to start with a stacked bar chart that shows the number of different surgeries performed in various Asian countries in 2015 (the most complete and recent set of data), a line chart for how the number of surgeries have increased in said countries for the past 10 years, and a map for the Asian countries on which cosmetic surgery participation is shown in color intensity (i.e. Color gets darker with higher numbers of surgery/products employed in each country).
